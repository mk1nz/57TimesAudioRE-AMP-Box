# Parts list I used in my build:
  R1, R2 - UXB02070F1202BCU00 Vishay Metal Film Resistors UXB 0207-10 0.1% CU 12K<br>
  R3 - MRS25000C5109FCT00 Vishay Metal Film Resistor - Through Hole MRS25-50 1% CT 51R<br>
  VR1 - P160KNPD-0QC15A10K BI Technologies / TT Electronics Potentiometer, 1/10W 10K Ohms 20% 16mm ROTARY POT<br>
  C1 - FKP3F021003F00KI00 Wima Film Capacitor FKP 3 0.01 uF 250 VDC 5x11x13 PCM 10<br>
  J2 - NRJ6HM-1-PRE Neutrik Phone Connector Jack 1/4" - stereo switched tip and ring (not sleeve), slim-full thread metal-PCBH-cha grd<br>
  J3 - NC3FD-H-B Neutrik XLR Connectors 3C FEMALE PCB BLK/GD<br>
  S1 - DPDT Standard Through Hole PCB Right Angle Push Button Self-lock Switch, similar to 22F02 (Please note that the part number on the schematic is incorrect and differs from that on the Gerber files.)<br>

WARNING: Soldering the pins of the LL1540 should be done as quickly as possible to avoid damaging the transformer. I soldered the transformer at 300 degrees Celsius using high quality flux, applying molten solder to each pin for about 2-3 seconds.
